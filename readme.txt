== Changelog ==
= 6.2 - Jun 25, 2018 =
- **New! Revamped floating cart icon.** We added a new floating cart widget that allows to display a cart icon along with items count and subtotal in the corner of the screen. This way, it's always visible and your customers can click it to check their cart contents and proceed with checkout. The new floating shopping cart icon looks better and provides a lot of layout customization options. You can enable it in the Customizer menu under "Ecwid" section in your WordPress admin backend: (Appearance → Customize → Ecwid).
- **Fixed a "Call to undefined function mb_strtolower" error message that appeared on some hosts.** If you saw such an error message, this should be fixed now. 
- **Fixed a minor issue with the way Ecwid clean URLs work with Divi theme.** If you're using Divi theme on your site, you might notice that product page links gave you a 404 error in some rare cases. It' fixed now.
- Minor fixes and improvements. 


= 6.1.1 - May 30, 2018 =
- **Compatibility with Gutenberg: buy now buttons in the page editor.** Gutenberg editor is getting more and more popular and will soon be the default WordPress editor. To make sure Ecwid users are ready for it, we are adding Gutenberg support to our plugin. In the previous update, we added a “Store” block to the Gutenberg editor toolbar. This update brings another button to the editor toolbar — “Ecwid product”. Use this one to add product widgets and buy now buttons to the pages and posts of your site.
- **Revamped cart widget for sidebar.** We added a new sidebar widget that allows to display a cart icon along with items count and subtotal in the sidebar. The new shopping cart icon widget looks better and provides a lot of layout customization options — don’t forget to play with its settings when adding it to your sidebar. You can find the new widget under Appearance → Widgets in your Wordpress admin backend. 
- **New design/appearance settings: new customization options for your storefront.** We added a lot of new design settings to your store dashboard. Read this detailed post to learn how to tweak your store appearance: [https://www.ecwid.com/blog/new-ecwid-design-settings-dozens-of-customization-options-no-coding.html](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/new-ecwid-design-settings-dozens-of-customization-options-no-coding.html)
- **Compatibility with WP Bakery page builder.** We fixed a few issues and made Ecwid widgets work fine in the “WP Bakery” page builder. Now you can use that sitebuilder with the Ecwid plugin — everything should work fine. 
- **Fixed a pre-renderering issue in IE browser.** The Ecwid e-commerce plugin adds prerender/preload tags to your site code — those are special html codes aimed to make the store page loads faster for your customers. This pre-rendering technology didn’t work well in old IE browsers (IE 11 and older) so we disabled it for IE visitors on your site. It works automatically, so no actions required from your side. 
- **Compatibility with Polylang plugin.** We got a report from one of our customers stating that Ecwid didn’t work well with Polylang plugin. We fixed an issue, now everything should work fine. 
- Improvements and fixes for the plugin navigation in the WP admin menu.
- Improvements and fixes for store pages SEO friendly urls. 
- Fixed a minor issue in the “Tools -> Import -> Ecwid products” section in the WP admin backend.

= 6.0.3 - Apr 19, 2018 =
- Fixed incorrect sorting in the store categories menu widgets. If you use display store categories inn your site menu or in a sidebar using the Ecwid categories sidebar widget, you might notice that the categories list order differs from that in your store control panel. We fixed that — now the sorting matches. 
- Fixed unclickable products/categories in storefront. This issue appeared in very rare occasions, when a site is running on https (like https://example.com) but someone opens it using an http link (http://example.com). If there was no redirect (it happens sometimes), you might notice that your store product listing doesn’t react on clicks in the http version of your site. We fixed that — now it works well in all cases. We recommend redirecting http to https version though anyway.

= 6.0.2 - Apr 13, 2018 =
- Fixed an error that occurred under specific server configurations.

= 6.0.1 - Apr 11, 2018 =
- **Compatibility with Gutenberg.** Gutenberg editor is getting more and more popular and will soon be the default WordPress editor. To make sure Ecwid users are ready for that, we added Gutenberg support to our plugin. Now when you edit a page in Gutenberg, you will see a new "Ecwid online store" block in the editor toolbar — this can be used to add a store to a page. In future updates, we will add ability to add a product widget (or a buy now button) to a post or page in Gutenberg.
- **New product import tools.** Some sellers copy their products to Ecwid e-commerce plugin from WooCommerce, other shopping carts or local database or spreadsheet. We made it easier to do that in Ecwid. You can now see a separate Ecwid block under Tools -> Import in the WordPress admin backend. That block allows you to import products and categories to your store from WooCommerce or external CSV file.
- **New WordPress admin dashboard widget: help/educational materials for sellers.** We added a new Ecwid block to the WordPress admin dashboard — it features useful posts from the Ecwid ecommerce blog. The block refreshes itself automatically when we publish a new blog post. Check it to find fresh product updates and tips and recommendations from the Ecwid team on how to better set up your store and sell more.
- **Revamped Ecwid menu in WordPress admin backend.** This is step #2 of the menu changes implemented in the version 5.8. Historically, the Ecwid store management dashboard displayed navigation within the central page content when you open it in your WordPress admin backend. So, you open the “Ecwid” menu in your WP admin and then navigate through your store admin pages inside that general “Ecwid” page. We’re improving this process: now the store admin navigation menu will be a part of the WordPress admin menu. So now you will find management/settings/apps and other sections right in the WordPress left-hand navigation sidebar. This will align the Ecwid plugin navigation with the general WordPress navigation and provide more natural way to find the right page of your store dashboard. Also, this will free some space in the page central area to make it more convenient to manage your store, especially on mobile devices.
- Minor fixes and improvements.
- 6.0.1 fixes compatibility issues with outdated php versions.

= 5.8.2 - Mar 9, 2018 =
- **Fixed an issue with the categories menu appeared in the version 5.8.1.** 

= 5.8.1 - Mar 7, 2018 =
- **Compatibility with the Yoast premium SEO plugin.** Yoast recently updated their SEO plugins. We adjusted Ecwid plugin to work well with them. So, as usually, Ecwid should work well with Yoast products, feel free to use them to get your site and online store optimized for search engines. 
- **Fixed an issue with Ecwid buttons in the Elementor page builder toolbar.** Ecwid’s “Add store” and “Add product” buttons didn’t work well in the Elementor editor toolbar. We hid the Ecwid buttons from the toolbar as a workaround. To add a store or a single product to a page in the Elementor editor, please use [ec_store] and [ec_product] shortcodes or temporarily switch to the default WP editor. 
- **Fixed compatibility issues with Themify AJAX themes.** If you use one of Themify themes with AJAX navigation enabled, you might notice that your store page didn’t load sometimes. We fixed that. Ecwid should work well with any Wordpress theme. 
- **Fixed an issue with SEO-friendly description on store product pages.** Ecwid ecommerce plugin renders your store pages in a special search engines friendly way so that they can index your products and display them better in search results. In some cases, product description wasn’t displayed in that SEO version of store page. We fixed that, everything should work fine and your products should be displayed well in Google search. 
- Minor fixes and improvements. 

= 5.8 - Feb 8, 2018 =
- **Improved OG tags support.** OpenGraph (or OG) tags are special marks in site pages code, that are used to make better snippets when you share a page on Facebook, Twitter and other sites and social networks. We added OG tags to the products pages — this will make your product title, description and image appear in a snippet/post when you share a link to that product. 
- **Revamped Ecwid menu in WordPress admin backend.** Historically, the Ecwid store management dashboard displayed navigation within the central page content when you open it in your Wordpress admin backend. So, you open the “Ecwid” menu in your WP admin and then navigate through your store admin pages within that general “Ecwid” page. We’re improving this process: now the store admin navigation menu will be a part of the Wordpress native admin menu, so you will find products/sales/settings/promotions/apps and other sections right in the Wordpress left-hand navigation sidebar. This will align the Ecwid plugin navigation with the general Wordpress navigation and provide more natural way to find the right page of your store dashboard. Also, this will free some space in the page central area to make it more convenient to manage your store, especially on mobile devices. IMPORTANT: The change is now enabled for the new plugin users only. We will gradually roll it out to all of the plugin users in the upcoming updates. 
- **Improved compatibility with Customizr theme (part 2).** We continue improving the Ecwid online store plugin to work well with a popular “Customizr” theme and to make the store appearance and behavior fit the theme better. This is a continue of the improvements for Customizr that we released in the previous plugin update. If you’re using the Customizr theme, please let us know what you think. 
- **Several minor fixes and improvements.** The Ecwid plugin is constantly updated with new features and tools. To see more updates, see [our ecommerce blog](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/ecwid-updates).

= 5.7.3 - Jan 18, 2018 =
- **Improved compatibility with Customizr theme.** We are inspecting how the plugin works with a popular “Customizr” theme and making the store appearance and behavior fit the theme better. This is the first part of improvements for Customizr, we will continue making it better in the future versions. 
- **Improvements in the way the plugin communicates with the Ecwid APIs.** We cleaned up the plugin code and improved its internal functions to make sure storefront and product widgets are using the newest Ecwid API and work more stable. 
- **Minor improvements in the SEO.** We made a few fixes and adjustments in canonical tags and SEO-friendly URLs functionality. 
- **Ecwid e-commerce service is constantly updated with new cool features and improvements.** To see more updates and learn something new about selling online, see [our blog](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/ecwid-updates).

= 5.7.2 - Dec 20, 2017 =
- **Fixed a couple of bugs on the Ecwid dashboard page.** The store control panel might not appear in the Wordpress backend for some users (especially it was likely to happen in Safari browser). We fixed it. So if you experienced that issue in your Wordpress admin backend, this update should fix it for you.
- **Added fixes and layout improvements to make Ecwid e-commerce plugin compatible with “Abubize Business” and “Evolve Plus” Wordpress themes.** If you use one of those themes, you might notice layout issues on your store page caused by the theme styles overriding Ecwid styles. We fixed that. If you find any trouble in how Ecwid works with your theme, please let us know.
- **Fixed an issue in the way Ecwid shortcode is rendered in the Wordpress page editor.** You might notice the Wordpress editor froze when you changed the "widgets" part of the Ecwid shortcode in the editor. For example, if you put a shortcode with categories widget only (without product browser). We fixed it — now you can adjust the shortcode as you wish. Note this problem only affected the Wordpress editor — neither your store nor your control panel were affected. So, if you don't customize the shortcode content, you can just ignore this, everything is working fine for you.
- **Several minor fixes and improvements.** Ecwid is constantly updated with new cool ecommerce features. To see more updates and learn something new about selling online, see [our blog](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/ecwid-updates).

= 5.7.1 =
- **Fix for the “The requested product is not available” error message appeared in the version 5.7**. The issue was caused by the new “Default product” feature. Some users found that error message when adding their store to a new page in the plugin and specifying the default category for that page. Everything should work fine now.

= 5.7 =
- **New feature in the [ecwid] shortcode — it’s now possible to specify the product that will be displayed by default when the store page is opened.** If you want to feature some product from your online store on one of the site pages or if you sell a single product, you can specify it in the new “default_product_id” parameter in the ecwid shortcode to make it opened by default. 
- **Speedup in the store navigation for your customers.** We improved Ecwid e-commerce sidebar widgets and menus in the storefront, they now work without page reload when a visitor is already on the store page. After the customer opens your store page, all further browsing will be super fast, including switching between products, opening categories, visiting recently viewed products etc.
- **Fixed an issue with title and description meta tags being changed by the Yoast SEO plugin on store pages.** If you have Yoast installed, you might notice this issue recently. Now your products and categories titles and descriptions will get to the page meta title/description tags with no problem. This should help Google index your catalog properly. 
- Ecwid is constantly updated with new cool ecommerce features and improvements. To see more updates and learn something new about selling online, see [our blog](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/ecwid-updates).

= 5.6.2 - Oct 25, 2017 =
- **Fixed an issue with custom store menu links.** You can add store pages to the site menu under “Appearance → Menu” in your WordPress site settings. Previously, these links might not work  if you added them in the recent weeks. We now fixed it, they should work fine. 
- **Fixed an issue with the browser back button and the customer cart content.** In some rare cases (when the Single Sign On tool is enabled), when a logged in store visitor clicked the back button in their browser, the cart content might be refreshed. We fixed that — whether you have the customer Single Sign On enabled or not, the storefront, cart and checkout should work properly.
- **Added compatibility with the “Above The Fold Optimization” plugin.** You can use that plugin along with the Ecwid shopping cart, everything should work fine with no issues. 
- **Fixed a slight layout issue with the “Optimizer” theme.** Product thumbnail pictures displayed improperly in that theme. Now they look OK. 
- **Added slight improvements and fixes for the admin backend layout.** 
- Ecwid is constantly updated with new cool ecommerce features and improvements. To see more updates and learn something new about selling online, see [our blog](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/ecwid-updates).

= 5.6.1 - Sep 29, 2017 =
- Fixed incompatibility of the plugin v5.6 with the servers running PHP 5.2.x

= 5.6 — Sep 27, 2017 =
- **Added a new sidebar widget — "Latest Products"!** Add this widget to your sidebar to let your customers know what's new in your online store. You will find the widget under Appearance -> Widgets section in your Wordpress admin backend.
- **Added SEO optimization for single product widgets.** Now, single product widgets will include SEO-friendly markup for product's title/price/availability data to let the search engines better index the page content. You can add single product widgets to your site pages using the "Add Product" button in the Wordpress page editor.
- **Slightly optimized loading speed.** The Ecwid Online Store plugin now loads less CSS/JS files on your site to decrease number of resources the visitor browser should process and to increase loading speed.
- **Fixed an issue with SEO friendly clean URLs.** On some sites in rare occasions, product URLs responded with 404 errors. If you encounter such behavior on your site, this update should fix that. All shop URLs should work fine now — they are available for visitors and are well indexed by search engines.
- **Various minor fixes and improvements** in random product widget, SEO functionality, store dashboard and other areas.
- Ecwid is constantly updated with new cool features and improvements. To see more updates and learn something new about selling online, see [our blog](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/ecwid-updates).

= 5.5 =
- **New random product widget.** A new sidebar widget allows you add a random product block to the site sidebar. Each time your customer opens or refreshes a page on your site, they will see one of your store products in the sidebar. Enable the new random product widget under Appearance→Widgets section in your Wordpress admin backend. Do not forget to add pictures to your products to bring site visitors’ attention to your store.
- Minor fixes and improvements. 

= 5.4.3 =
- **Speed optimization for the plugin settings pages.** We improved the plugin admin settings code to make sure it requires less time and resources and thus works faster. 
- **Fixed a bug in the integration with the Google XML Sitemaps plugin.** The sitemaps generated by that plugin might contain invalid data related to the store product pages. That was caused by a bug in the Ecwid plugin. We fixed that, your sitemap should work fine now. 
- **Fixed the “preg_match” warning messages appearing in rare occasions on the plugin pages.** If you happen to see those messages on your site, please update the Ecwid online store plugin, it should fix them.
- **Bug fixes and improvements for the SEO content of the product and categories pages on the site.** This is for search engines to be able to index your store better. 

= 5.4.2 =
- **Loading speed optimization for the Single Product widgets.** We continue working on improving the Ecwid ecommerce plugin loading speed. This update includes optimization of single product widgets. The optimization should have especially good effect if you added multiple single product widgets on a page (e.g. for creating a featured slider or a customized products grid).
- **The Recently Viewed Products widget is also optimized.** It now works much faster. If you haven’t used the widget before, feel free to enable it under Appearance -> Widgets.
- **The legacy “Appearance” settings page is removed from the plugin admin menu.** The old “Appearance” settings page was removed from the plugin settings navigation. To configure the product catalog settings (displayed widgets, products per page etc), you can open your store page for editing in the WordPress admin backend and click the “Edit appearance” button there. If you don’t have a store on the page, click the “Add store” button in the page editor and set the appearance settings there — they will be applied to your store on that page.
- **Fixed “Strict standards” code notices.** Some users may discover this notice on their site, if the debugging messages are not disabled in the Wordpress installation. That didn’t affect the store functionality, but looked odd. We fixed that — there should not be any warning messages displayed now.
- Minor fixes and improvements.

= 5.4.1 =
- Fixed an issue with the store page loading in the newest version 5.4. In some rare occasions, the store page might not display right after update to the version 5.4. We fixed the issue to make sure all stores are working well.
- Added a workaround for a conflict with the third party “Product Advisor for Ecwid” plugin. The “Product Advisor” plugin has a bug that prevents it from working correctly with the newest versions of the Ecwid plugin. When the Product advisor plugin is enabled, the site pages do not respond. We added a workaround to the Ecwid plugin to make sure the WP admin pages will work well for the “Product advisor”. So, if you’re using the “Product advisor” plugin and see any issue with your site now, please disable that plugin in your WP admin backend. We’re speaking with the author of the Product advisor plugin so there will hopefully be a solution soon.


= 5.4 =
- **Improvements in the SEO friendly versions of product pages, which are indexed by search engines.** This includes optimized product price format, canonical tags and minor adjustments for SEO titles and descriptions. This is another improvement for search crawlers to better index store pages.
- **Adjustments for the “All in one SEO” plugin** to make sure it works well with the Ecwid’s new clean URLs.
- **Fixed “preg match” PHP warning messages**, which appeared on some sites with the Ecwid ecommerce plugin enabled.
- **Fixed an issue with site images in the Newsmag Wordpress theme** — some images were not displayed well with Ecwid. We fixed that so everything should work fine in the Newsmag theme now.  
- **Several fixes and improvements for the floating minicart widget.**
- **Loading speed improvements.** We optimized the plugin code to render store pages and widgets faster.

= 5.3.1 =
- **Fix for the “Add product” button in the WordPress editor.** The button was broken in the latest version (5.3) — it generated invalid shortcode for the single product widgets. The problem didn’t affect existing product widgets, but the new ones didn’t render. It’s now fixed. If you faced a trouble adding product widgets to your pages and posts, please update the plugin and try again.

= 5.3 =
- **Fixes and improvements for the new clean URLs functionality.** The new clean URLs for your online store are now more stable and the product pages are more SEO friendly. The changes include: fix in the processing of non-latin characters in the product URLs; adjustment for the sharing metatags on the product pages (rel shortlink meta tags); fix for the store terms&conditions and signin links to make them work properly with the new clean URLs.
- **Fix for the Recently Viewed Product widget and the “Minimaze” theme.** The widget didn’t work well in this theme. Now you can use Recently Viewed Products with the Minimaze theme as well as with any other Wordpress theme.
- **Layout improvements and fixes for the “Ribosome”, “Edge” and “OptimizePress” Wordpress themes.** If you use one of those themes, you might notice minor layout issues in your e-commerce catalog or in the appearance of minicart widget. The troubles should be fixed now.
- **Fixed a “404 not found” issue, when Ecwid is used with the “Sublanguage” plugin.** If you noticed some of your pages respond with 404 errors when Sublanguage and Ecwid plugins are both activated, this update should fix that.
- **Improvements for the product pages SEO when Yoast plugin is used on the site.** If you have the new Ecwid clean URLs enabled in your shop and are using Yoast, this improvement should make meta tags and canonical tags work better on your site with the new URLs.

= 5.2 =
- **Major improvement in the speed of loading storefront.** The plugin now renders ecommerce pages and loads store widgets much more quicker both for your visitors and search engines.
- **SEO improvements for product and categories pages when SEO friendly URLs are enabled.** Now a special plain version of the product page content is generated and loaded in background along with a regular product/category page. This new version is formatted to provide product and category information in a clear and understandable format for crawl robots that cannot parse JavaScript — this makes your store indexable by other search engines besides Google (e.g. Yandex). This special version is not visible in a browser, so your customers will as usually get the full store version. Please do not forget to enable new SEO friendly clean URLs to get this working on your site.

= 5.1.1 =
- **Fixed the “Strict code standards” notices** appearing on some sites with Ecwid plugin enabled. The messages didn’t affect the product catalog and checkout, but looked confusing for the site visitors. We fixed that. The notices should disappear now.
- Minor improvement for the SEO friendly clean URLs function.

= 5.1 =
- **Improved SEO friendly clean URLs tool.** Previously, if you had your store installed on different pages of your site (e.g. different store categories on different site pages), the SEO URLs worked on the main store/catalog page only. Now it should work fine on all pages you add your store to. Please make sure you use the “Add store” editor button when adding your store to the site pages.
- **The new categories menu widget is now enabled for every site.** We released the new categories widget in the version 3.4 — it is mobile friendly and looks great with any wordpress ecommerce theme. We made it possible to turn on/off the new widget temporarily to make sure every site would have time to try it before it’s enabled for everyone. Now it’s enabled. If you have enabled it previously, nothing will change for you — your categories widget is already updated. If you have the old categories widget displayed on your site, this update will replace it with the new one. Please let us know if you have any trouble with the new widget.
- **Fixes and improvements for the SEO friendly clean URLs option.** We continue polishing the new Ecwid URLs (added in the v.5) to make sure they work well in every store. Have any feedback on your store URLs? Please let us know.

= 5.0.7 =
- **SEO improvement for canonical tags on the product and category pages.** The Ecwid ecommerce plugin now hides the store root page canonical and dynamically adds corresponding canonical tags to the product and category pages as you browse the store. This is to improve the pages visibility for search engines, when the new clean URLs option is enabled.
- **Fixed layout issue in the Wordpress 2017 theme.** We found an issue with the way Ecwid online stores are displayed in the default Wordpress “Twenty Seventeen” theme — the stores pages appeared too narrow. We fixed that.

= 5.0.6 =
- **Fixed a loading speed issue.** Some sites with the Ecwid ecommerce plugin might have troubles with loading speed, when store categories menu was enabled. We optimized the way Ecwid renders and displays the store categories navigation so the issue should be fixed now.

= 5.0.5 =
- **Fixed a a bug causing 404 errors on the store page when SEO friendly URLs are enabled.** The issue appeared on the sites where store is placed on the site home page. Now the clean SEO URLs option should work fine regardless of whether you add Ecwid store to your site home page or any other page.

- Minor fixes and improvements.

= 5.0.4 =
- Minor fixes for the new SEO friendly clean URLs feature.

= 5.0.3 =
- **SEO friendly clean URLs.** This is major new feature that we recommend everyone to enable. We made store pages URLs clean and SEO friendly. The new URLs do not contain hash sign ("#"), which makes your store better indexed by Google. There are less extra characters like '/', '~' or'!', so the page address looks cleaner. As previously, the new product and category pages URLs include product/category titles to make them easily readable both for Google and for your customers. Of course, no page refresh happens when the customer browses your store: the store pages with new URLs work without page reload, as it's been always worked in Ecwid. So, you have your quickly loading store pages with new SEO friendly URLs. To enable the new URLs, navigate to the Ecwid plugin Advanced settings and tick the "SEO friendly URLs" checkbox. Note: the old URLs format is supported as well, so all your existing links will continue to work fine. 

- **An improvement for the floating cart sidebar widget.** Now, when you add the widget to any sidebar, the widget will displayed on every site page regardless of whether the sidebar is available on that page or not. This makes it easier for your customer to access their shopping cart and check out. 

- **A few fixes for the integrated search.** Recently we added a new feature that integrates your site search with your store products to list them when your customers use the site's general post/page search. We continue improving it and fixing issues you are reporting. Thank you! 

- **A few improvements and fixes for the "Add product" button in the WordPress editor** to make it easier for your to add your store products to your site pages. 


= 4.9.4 =
- **The new search widget is now enabled for every site.** We released the new search widget in the version 4.2 — it is mobile friendly and looks great with any wordpress ecommerce theme. We made it possible to turn on/off the new widget temporarily to make sure every site would have time to try it before it’s enabled for everyone. Now it’s enabled. If you have it enabled previously, nothing will change for you — your search widget is already updated. If you have the old search widget displayed on your site, this update will replace it with the new one. Please let us know if you have any trouble with the new widget.
- **Fixed a minor issue with displaying store control panel on the Ecwid Dashboard page in Wordpress admin backend**. The control panel previously might be displayed with a horizontal scrolling. We fixed that — it should look fine now.
- Layout fixes for the ZeroGravity Wordpress theme.

= 4.9.3 =
- **Fixed an issue with erroneous “Restore backup” messages in the editor in Wordpress admin backend.** One of the recent changes in our plugin made the WordPress editor display messages like “The backup of this post in your browser is different from the version below.” In fact, the messages did not mean there was a change that had not been not saved. The restore backup messages are normally hidden by Wordpress, but one of our CSS changes (editor page layout tweaks) made them appear. All your data is safe and the warning messages were displayed by mistake. We fixed them now and they should not appear anymore.

= 4.9.2 =
- **Improvements and fixes for the new "Add product" button in the Wordpress editor.** We recently added a tool for inserting a product from your store to any page or post on your site. In this update, we polished the tool look and feel, fixed a few issues and improved performance. To try it, click the "Add product" button in the editor in your Wordpress admin backend.
- **Fixed an issue with the "Screen options" and "Help" Wordpress menus in the page editor in Wordpress admin backend.** Those Wordpress functions were slightly affected by the new "Add product" functionality of the Ecwid e-commerce plugin and might not work well. We fixed that. Everything should work properly now.
- **A few fixes for the new integrated search functionality.** Feel free to enable and try the new search feature on the plugin settings (Ecwid Store -> Advanced) — it will make your store products available in your site regular pages/posts search.

= 4.9.1 =
- **Fixed an issue in the new integrated search functionality** causing javascript errors on site pages where no store widgets are installed. Feel free to enable and try the new search feature on the plugin settings (Ecwid Store -> Advanced)
- **Improvement for the Single Sign On.** If you have Single Sign On (SSO) enabled in the plugin settings and your customer do not have name specified in their profile, the store account will use their nickname as the firstname. This will make store more friendly for your new buyers. (edited)

= 4.9 =
- **Integration with Wordpress search**. This new feature will make your ecommerce site search find store products among other site pages and posts. So, when your customer searches for something on your site, they will see both site content and store products in the search results and will be able to navigate directly to the product pages from there. Please enable it on the Ecwid/Advanced settings page in your Wordpress backend and do not forget to click "Synchronize products" link. The feature is now in beta stage and we are actively improving it. So if you face any trouble with it, please let us know.

= 4.8 =
- **New "Add product" button in the Wordpress post and page editor.** Now you have a useful and easy tool to place a product from your store on any page or post on your site. Just open any post or page in your Wordpress admin panel, click the "Add product" button in the editor, select the product you want to see on that page and click "Insert" – a product widget will appear on that page after you publish the chnages. The new "Add product" popup allows customizing the appearance of the widget so you can choose whether you want to see the picture along with title, price and quantity selector or just a simple Buy now button. Product widgets that you put on your site are seamlessly integrated with your store and shopping cart — wherever you place a product or buy now button on your site, the customers will be able to add it to the cart and proceed to checkout as if it was a regular store page. We recommend using product widgets and buy now buttons on every page or post where you mention the products or services you sell – this way you will provide an easy and natural way for a customer to know more about the product and buy it from the same page, be it a blog post, an "About" page, a testimonial or any other page on your ecommerce site. Enjoy!

= 4.7.6 =
- Fix for the legacy search shortcode ([ecwid_searchbox]), which was broken in the recent 4.7.5 release.

= 4.7.5 =
- **A few enhancements for the Wordpress brand new "Twenty Seventeen" theme.** Ecwid store page in that theme will look better with this update – we made the page layout a bit wider to make sure it's convenient for your buyers to navigate the catalog. 
- **Another improvement for the new Ecwid single product widget.** Now it's possible to use the "center_align=1" parameter in the shortcode to make the widget center aligned on the page. You may want to use that if you place one product widget per page – in this case, it will look better when center-aligned. An example shortcode: [ecwid_product id="12345" version=2 center_align=1]. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID.
- Minor fixes for the "Trend" Wordpress theme.

= 4.7.4 =
- **WordPress 4.7 and Twenty Seventeen theme compatibility.** The new WordPress version with the 2017 theme is coming soon. Ecwid shopping cart plugin is ready for the upcoming changes – everything will work well. Feel free to upgrade your site to WordPress 4.7 as soon as it's released and try a new theme. 
- Minor fixes and improvements.

= 4.7.3 =
- **Improvements for the new Ecwid’s single product widget.** Now it's possible to use the "show_price_on_button=0" and “show_border=0” parameters in the shortcode to disable the price on buy now button and widget border respectively. If you want to hide the widget border, for example, the resulting code will like this: [ecwid_product id="12345" version=2 show_border=0]. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID.
- Fixed a bug with the floating shopping cart: the floating cart widget didn't appear on some rare Wordpress themes, we fixed that. Now it should work fine.

= 4.7.2 =
- **Added support for the Ecwid’s improved single product widgets.** To feature a single product on a separate page or blog post of your ecommerce site, you can use the [ecwid_product] shortcode. We improved the look and feel of the single product widgets in Ecwid and added those improvements to the single product shortcode version #2. You can use it like this: [ecwid_product id="12345" version=2]. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID. 
- **Fixed error messages appearing on some Wordpress sites with the "Trend" theme installed.** If you use Ecwid shopping cart with Trend theme and recently noticed an error message in your site admin backend, please use this update this update – it should fix that issue. 

= 4.7.1 =
- Fixed a few warning messages appearing on some sites with the new version of the plugin.

= 4.7 =
- Fixed a layout issue in the floating cart widget in the "Mobius" WordPress theme.

= 4.6.2 =
- Fix for the legacy search shortcode ([ecwid_searchbox]), which was broken in the recent 4.6 release.

= 4.6.1 =
- The latest update (v 4.6) had a bug in the sidebar widgets (search box and recently viewed products). The widgets did not display and generated error/warning messages on the sites. We fixed that. 
- Another issue with the latest update is related to the legacy Ecwid shortcodes ([ecwid_script], [ecwid_productbrowser] etc). On the old installations (2 years old and more), the warning messages appeared – you might notice them on the store page. We now fixed this and everything should be fine, all Ecwid plugin installations work well.

= 4.6 =
- **Compatibility with the "Contact form 7 designer" plugin** . When installed, the "Contact form 7 designer" plugin  adds its own code to the <html> and <body> tags on the page on every page of the site. This conflicted with Ecwid storefront styles. We fixed that – now if you use the both plugin t the same time, your site pages styles should work fine. Note: this plugin is not the same as the popular "Contact form 7". Ecwid ecommerce functionality works well with the latter, so don't worry if you use it on your site. 
- **Fix for a store links issue in the "Flora" theme by Wyde.** Users with "Flora" theme on their sites reported that there are glitches in the way Ecwid online store links behave in that theme. We fixed that – Ecwid now works well with "Flora". 
- **Compatibility with the "Trend" Wordpress theme.** Ecwid shopping cart is designed to work great with all WordPress themes. However, we sometimes see that Ecwid has troubles working with some AJAX-driven WordPress themes. We found a way to fix this and started working on improving the plugin. With this release, the Ecwid plugin becomes compatible with the beautiful "Trend" theme. We'll get to the other AJAX themes in the future releases. If you find a theme that Ecwid has troubles with, please let us know – we'll fix that.
- **Fixed a bug with the store menu item duplicates.** In a recent update, we fixed duplicate Store pages appearing when you deactivate and re-activate the plugin several times. In this release, we fixed a similar bug with the "Store" menu items. However often you enable/disable the plugin, the site navigation menu now works properly, keeping a single Store link, unless you deliberately add a few shop links to the menu (e.g. to have store category links in the menu).
- Minor improvement and fixes to make the plugin more stable and user friendly. 


= 4.5 =
- **Update in the Single Sign On Module (Ecwid SSO).** Single Sign-On allows your customers to have a single login for your WordPress site and your Ecwid store. We updated it to use the latest Ecwid ecommerce APIs to make it more convenient for you. Now the module doesn't require a separate API key – it works seamlessly with no extra setup.
- **Compatibility with Divi builder editor.** Divi builder adds a nice WYSIWYG editor to the Wordpress admin. Ecwid shopping cart now is compatible with that editor – so you can add Ecwid store shortcode right from the Divi builder editor, no need to switch back to the default Wordpress editor if you prefer to use the Divi's one. 
- **Fix for a bug in the store appearance popup.** The store widgets settings were hidden when the "widgets" part was manually removed from the Ecwid shortcode in the page editor in Wordpress admin. We fixed that, now the settings popup should work fine. 
- **Slight improvements in Chameleon.** The "Chameleon skin" option in the plugin Advanced settings automatically adjusts the store texts and styles to match those of your site. We continue improving it so that it works better with all sites. 
- **Fixed a bug with store pages duplicates.** Previously, an extra Store page was created each time you deactivated and re-activated the plugin. It's fixed – now the Ecwid plugin remembers the store page and use it however often you deactivate/activate the plugin. 
- Slight layout improvements for the stores embedded into sites with Salient theme installed.

= 4.4.3 =
- **Minor fixes and improvements.**

= 4.4.2 =
- **Fixed a few layout issues in the categories menu layout and the "Store root categories" widget.** Both wigets should look good now on any site and let your customers navigate your store easily. If you find any issue in the categories navigation in your store, please let us know. 
- **Fixed an issue for meta title and description fields (SEO) for the sites with Yoast SEO plugin installed.** The issue appeared on the sites where the store is installed on the main (home) page – meta title and description didn't work properly. We fixed this. Ecwid shopping cart plugin is totally compatible with Yoast SEO so we recommend using them together to make your store more visible in search engines.

= 4.4.1.2 =
- Fixes PHP warning messages appearing on some server configurations.

= 4.4.1 =
- **Fixed notice/warning messages that appeared in rare cases in a sitemap generated by 3d-party Sitemap/SEO plugins.** Now sitemaps should be generated without any error messages.

- **Fixed an issue with the "Default category" drop-down in the store page appearance settings.** You might notice that the Default category list in the store page settings didn't show a category if you just created that category in your online store. We updated this tool so that it faster reacts on creating new categories. 
- **Fixed an issue with price display in the Recently viewed products sidebar widget.** You might notice that the Recently Viewed Products widget didn't display product prices on your site – we fixed that.

= 4.4 =
- **New store categories sidebar widget.** The new categories widget displays your online store root categories list in the site sidebar to let your customers navigate the store easily. Compared to the legacy sidebar categories widget, the new one fits your site layout perfectly – its style is fully based on your theme fonts and styles and looks good on any device and screen size. Find it under Appearance->Widgets->Store Root Categories.
- **Fixed an issue with the categories list in the page default category option.** Ecwid Ecommerce plugin allows you to define a store category shown by default when a customer opens the store page. This could be used to feature some part of your products or display different categories on different site pages. In some cases, the drop-down selector of categories in this tool didn't have the actual categories list from your store (e.g. when you add a new category). We fixed this. You can continue using this tool – it should work good.
- A few minor fixes and improvements.

= 4.3 =
- **New Minicart Widget.** We added a new floating minicart widget.  You can enable it on the "Appearance -> Widgets"  page in you Wordpress backend. The new search widget appears as soon as a customer adds something to the cart and resides at the top right or bottom right position on the screen so that the customer always sees it and can easily proceed to checkout. The minicart widget also contains a counter displaying the number of products in the cart. Feel free to add it to your site – it's free!
- **Look and feel improvements and minor layout fixes in the themes Zerif-lite, Storefront, Pixova-lite and Accesspress Mag.** Thanks to the Chameleon skin feature we released a few months ago, Ecwid looks good with every Wordpress theme. Now it became even better in these four popular themes.
- **Fixed a bug on the category pages in mobile view.** In some Wordpress themes, click on category icon returned an error and got customer back to the category listing page, when the store was opened from a mobile device. We fixed that and now there shouldn't be any troubles with viewing your shop on mobile devices.
- **Fixed a bug preventing Ecwid plugin working well with the Envira Galleries plugin.** Those of you using Envira Galleries on the site might notice it doesn't work properly on the pages containing Ecwid. We fixed that, you can now use the both plugins, they should work fine together.
- **Improved the plugin settings page footer.** It now includes a link to the mobile app page inside Ecwid Control Panel, which significantly simplified the Ecwid mobile apps installation.
- **Fixed a few more minor bugs on the plugin settings pages.** We're constantly improving the plugin settings pages to make store managements as convenient as possible. If you find any trouble working with your store in the plugin, please let us know.

Refer to the new Ecwid->Help page in your Wordpress admin backend.
- **Better compatibility with Accesspress Store and Sliding Door themes.** We adjusted Ecwid storefront look a bit to better match these Wordpress themes layout and fonts.

The new search widget is fully adaptive, automatically fits in its parent section, and looks great with any ecommerce theme. It also fits your sidebar even if it's very narrow, so feel free to add product search to your site sidebar in the "Appearance -> Widgets" section of your site admin.
- **Fixed a bug in the categories menu on mobile devices.** You might notice that the product categories menu disappeared on your site when it's opened on a mobile device with narrow screen. It's now fixed – the categories menu looks great on any screen size.

= 4.1.3 =
- Improvements for the plugin Dashboard page layout and a few minor fixes. 

= 4.1.2 =

Why bother to install it? It allows you to manage your store and sell on the go. 
- **Fixes for the embedded store Control Panel.** There were issues in the store control panel when the Wordpress site was hosted on a server with incorrect system date set. We made the plugin tolerant of this kind of hosting issues – the embedded ecommerce Control Panel should now be displayed fine on every server. 
- **A fix for the Advanced settings page in the plugin backend.** In some rare cases, the advanced settings page in the plugin didn't show the Chameleon option, which enables auto adjustment of the store layout. We fixed that and the Chameleon option is now available for every user. A good moment to try it, if you haven't yet.
- A few miscellaneous fixes and improvemens in the plugin core. 

= 4.1.1 =
- **Layout improvements for the Accesspress-mag theme.**  Accesspress-mag theme users might notice slight glitches in the store buttons. We fixed those.
- **Added the page default category dropdown for free users.** When you add a store on your site page, you can set the store category to be displayed on that page. This "default category" tool was previously just a text input where you were supposed to put the category ID, if you're on free Ecwid plan. Now it's a dropdown menu so you can easily select a store category for each page. It's very useful if you want to display different categories on different pages of your site. 
- Minor bug fixes and improvements

= 4.1 =
- **Product images are included in the sitemap generated by the Yoast SEO plugin.** Ecwid is integrated with popular SEO plugins: Yoast SEO and Google XML Sitemaps, which allows merchants to generate a sitemap containing the links to their products and categories. Now, the sitemaps generated by Yoast SEO  will also automatically include links to the product images. This will make Google better index your products pictures and list them in the search results. 
- **Ecwid plugin now supports oEmbed discovery.** As of version 4.4, WordPress supports oEmbed. In short, that's a tool which makes a link to a post or a page of your site looks nice when pasted on another site supporting this. Ecwid ecommerce plugin now supports it too, so if you paste a link to your store page on any other oEmbed-empowered site (e.g. another Wordpress site), it will automatically displays a nice widget with the page title and a list of your store categories. 
- Fixes and improvements for the storefront widgets and for the plugins admin pages. 


= 4.0.7 =
- **Fixed a problem with connecting to the Ecwid API on the servers with misconfigured or outdated CURL.** Some servers couldn't connect to Ecwid from to display the Ecwid Control Panel inside Wordpress backend. That caused a "Connection problem" error message, which some of Ecwid users saw in their Wordpress admin section. We added a fix that should resolve this problem and make the Ecwid Ecommerce Control Panel inside Wordpress work OK for those users. 
- Improvements for the new drop-down categories store menu added in the version 4 of the plugin. If you haven't tried it yet, go check it out in the Appearance -> Menus settings of your site.

We're keeping an eye on this and help Google improve indexing of all Ecwid stores. In this update, we made the product/categories page titles and descriptions change on the fly (with no page reload) so that Google will index them better. No action is required from your side – we will continue improving how your online store appears for Google to make sure your products and categories will get to the search results.
- **Fixed a bug affecting the "Re-connect Ecwid account" link.** The "Disconnect the Ecwid store and connect to another one" link at the bottom of the plugin dashboard now works fine.
- **Fixed a bug affecting the sites with enabled JetPack's "Spelling and grammar" module.** The Ecwid ecommerce plugin v4 conflicted with that spelling module from JetPack, which affected the process of a publishing new posts and pages.

To make it even better, we added the Products and Sales shortcuts to your Wordpress admin menu – feel free to use them to easily access your inventory and sales list.
- **New Drop-down Categories Menu.** Noticed how WordPress automatically updates your site menu adding your site pages to it? Ecwid now does it too: open "Appearance -> Menus" in your Wordpress control panel and add the "Store with Categories Menu" item to your site menu. A drop-down menu containing your store categories will automatically appear on your site. It will keep the categories list up to date even if you often change your store categories. Rest assured your customers can easily quickly get to the category of products they are interested in right from the site menu.
- **More Store Menu Items for your site.** In addition to the drop-down categories list, the new "Store" menus section under Appearance -> Menus provides "Search", "Cart" and "My Account" items. Add those quick links to your site for your customers to browse your store easier. 
- **Bug Fixes and Improvements.** As usual, we fine-tuned the plugin and fixed a few bugs.

= 3.4.4 =

It's now fixed so if you use the plugin, everything should work fine and Google will index your products pages properly.
- **Fixed a problem in the recently viewed products widget caused by Autoptimize plugin.** Previously, if Autoptimize plugin is used on the site, the recently viewed products widget reset the displayed products when page reloads. We fixed that.

= 3.4.1 =

- **New look for the categories menu widget.** The old Ecwid categories menu widget (horizontal categories) was created long time ago and has been working in thousands of Ecwid stores. However, it doesn't adapt itself for the customer screen size as well as the other Ecwid widgets do. This has been always be a problem for responsive sites which look good on mobile devices. The new widget is fully responsive and looks great on mobile devices. To enable the new look of the categories widget on your site, navigate to Ecwid plugin settings -> "Advanced" tab and tick the "Enable the new category menu" checkbox. Once enabled, it will your store menu widget to the new look. If you don't have this option on the Advanced page, that means you installed the plugin after this change and the new categories are already enabled in your store. Enjoy! 
- **Bigger product images for search engines.** The plugin used to generate small product thumbnails on special store pages for search engines. Now it displays the original large product pictures there to assure better indexing of your product images in Google. Please make sure you're on one of Ecwid paid plans to make your products along with the pictures indexable by search engines.

- **Fixed SEO issues on the sites with Genesis theme.** The Genesis theme places a special 'canonical' tag on each site page to improve the SEO of the pages. This in some cases conflicted with Ecwid ecommerce plugin. We overcame this from our side and now the plugin is compatible with SEO features of Genesis theme – your online store should be better indexed by search engines with this improvement.

= 3.3.1 =
- **Small improvement for "Twenty Twelve" WordPress theme.** The default drop down menu stayed open after clicking Ecwid links sometimes. We adjusted our plugin to work around this issue.

= 3.3 =
- **Improved Single Sign On functionality.** Single Sign On module has been available in Ecwid ecommerce plugin for a while – it makes it possible for your customers to sign into your Wordpress site and fully use the Ecwid store installed on the site without having to sign in to Ecwid. Now we added a few improvements that should make the feature more useful. In particular, the Ecwid's "Sign in" link was usually hidden when Single Sign On is used, supposing a customer should use the Wordpress login functionality. Now, we made the link visible and redirecting to the Wordpress login form to avoid confusing the user who otherwise has to look for the area to login.
- **Storefront layout improvements for the "Evolve" WordPress theme.** We adjusted Ecwid plugin to better integrate with a popular and beautiful free Wordpress theme – Evolve. In particular, we fixed the borders appearing around every storefront element in this theme. Ecwid stores now look a way better on WordPress sites with Evolve theme to provide better customer experience on any device and to generate more sales in your store. 
- **Compatibility with Autoptimize plugin.** One of Ecwid users recently reported an issue – the plugin doesn't work well on the sites with Autoptimize plugin installed. We fixed this in our plugin – it is now working well with Autoptimize. Feel free to use it on your site.

= 3.2.2 = 
- Fixed a few minor bugs in the Chameleon skin feature

= 3.2.1 =
- Fixed an issue in the new "Chameleon skin” tool that could affect font styles on the site.

= 3.2 =
- **New "Chameleon skin" tool (beta).** You can use it to adjust your online store styles to fit your Wordpress theme. Whatever Wordpress theme you use, Ecwid ecommerce plugin will detect predominant colors and font and use them in your product catalog. The feature is by default disabled on the existing accounts to make sure the update will not affect your storefront. To enable it on your site, open the "Advanced" page in the Ecwid plugin settings and tick the "Chameleon skin" checkbox. The feature is in beta so if you find any troubles with it, please let us know. 
- **Pre-populate Ecwid registration form fields with user Wordpress profile data.** When a new user installs the plugin and registers an account at Ecwid, the registration form will contain the name and email prefilled to make it easy for the merchant to create a new store and install it on their site. 
- **Improvements of the plugin settings pages to make them look good on mobile devices.** If you manage your Wordpress site from a phone or tablet, feel free to check the store settings there – Ecwid plugin settings pages now work better on mobile.

= 3.1 =
- **New recommendations block in Wordpress Dashboard.** Every Ecwid user has access to a lot of built-in features and third party applications that can be used to extend the store functionality and attract more sales. To make those features more visible and inform you of the new and existing tools you can use in your store, we added a new "Recommendations for your store" widget to the dashboard page in your Wordpress backend. We will update the content of this ecommerce widget from time to time to provide more actual advice and inform of the new applications and features, so stay tuned.
- **Storefront layout improvements for the "Customizr" WordPress theme.** Ecwid plugin is by design compatible with any theme and looks good on any device and screen size your customers use.

Ecwid stores now look a way better on WordPress ecommerce sites with Customizr themes to provide better customer experience on any device and to generate more sales in your store. 
- **Added German translations to the plugin settings pages in Wordpress admin backend.** Thanks to Stefan Wagner for the great job on the plugin translation.
- **Improved Italian translations for the plugin settings pages.** Big thanks to Luciano Delfico who has contributed a lot of Italian translations to Ecwid.
- **Improvements for Recently Viewed Products.** We rolled out a few improvements and bug fixes for the recently viewed products widget. It now displays a link to the store page when there are no products in the list; the thumbnails pictures shown in the sidebar are now of the better quality; the currently opened product is now not displayed in the list if there are other recently viewed products.
- **Slight improvements in Single Sign On functionality.** If you use Single Sign On, the plugin will now send user first name and last name along with user email to your Ecwid store when a new user is registered on your site. This allows you to make tighter integration of your site and your Ecwid store – your customer name will appear at checkout automatically if they enter their name on your site.
- **Fixed an invalid meta description bug**, which appeared in some rare cases when product description contained special characters.
- **Fixed a bug in XML sitemap generation.** Some users faced a problem with XML sitemaps generated by Ecwid for Yoast SEO plugin (malformed product pages URLs). It's fixed. You can use Yoast SEO plugin to make your products listed in your XML site map.

= 3.0 =
- **New sidebar widget: Recently Viewed Products.** A new Ecwid's sidebar ecommerce widget is now available – your site can now show the products that the customer has recently visited. The links and images in the sidebar are updated automatically, so the customer can return to the product they previously opened and probably decide to buy it. This will increase visibility of your products for the customers and generate more sales. Enable the new widget under Appearance->Widgets menu in your admin backend.
- **New design of the plugin Dashboard.** The dashboard ("Ecwid") page in the plugin backend is now nicer and more useful. 
- **Completely redesigned Registration page.** This is for the new users of the plugin. When installing the plugin, a user will now see a beautiful welcome page that will introduce them to Ecwid and guide through the setup process. 
- **New easier store connection.** Previously, to connect an Ecwid store with a Wordpress site and display store products, a new user had to copy and paste their store ID from Ecwid Control Panel. Now, even this easy step became easier – the user only needs to click a few buttons to authorize themselves and the plugin will automatically detect and connect their store. For those with technical background: we use oAuth2 for this, which is now a part of the newest Ecwid API.


= 2.8 =
- **Integration with the XML sitemap functionality of Yoast and All in One SEO Pack plugins.** Ecwid has been integrated with Google XML Sitemaps plugin allowing you to generate a sitemap containing the links to your products and categories. Now, the sitemaps generated by Yoast SEO and All in One SEO plugins will also include online store pages, if you're on a paid Ecwid plan.
- **Improved design of Ecwid sidebar controls in the Appearance/Widgets page in Wordpress backend.** Store sidebar widgets controls are now more noticeable and responsive.

= 2.7.3 =
- Several bug fixes and minor improvements for the new "Add Store" button in WordPress Editor

= 2.7.2 =
- **A new sidebar ecommerce widget: Ecwid Store Page Link.** The widget adds your store page link to the site's sidebar. You may want to use it with blog-focused WordPress themes that don't have a navigation menu, e.g. the upcoming "Twenty Fifteen" theme. Also, you can consider adding the widget to your sidebar to make your store page more visible to your visitors. 
- **Wordpress 4.1 and Twenty Fifteen theme compatibility.** The new WordPress version is coming soon and bringing a brand new 'Twenty Fifteen' theme. Ecwid plugin is now totally ready for the upcoming changes and will work OK in the new environment. Feel free to upgrade your site to Wordpress 4.1 as soon as it's released.
- A few minor improvements and bugfixes for the new "Add Store" button released in the version 2.7

= 2.7.1 =
- Fixed a few issues with the store appearance settings that were discovered in the recently released update (v2.7)

= 2.7 =
- **A brand new 'Add store' tool in WordPress editor toolbar.** Ecwid is now integrated with WordPress WYSIWYG editor: click the 'Add Store' button in the page editor toolbar, chose widgets to show, adjust the appearance and place your store on any page of your site. Now you can decide what store widgets to show and configure store appearance right in the page editor.
- **New "[ecwid]" shortcode.** The new ecommerce shortcode allows you to control every aspect of your store appearance by means of tweaking the shortcode parameters right in the store page code. Display/hide the search widget, choose the minicart layout you like, display different store categories on different site pages and so on. This shortcode serves the "Add Store" button mentioned above and almost every tweak is available in the new "Add Store" window so you don't have to edit any code in most cases. Still, an advanced Wordpress user may consider using shortcodes for more flexible and quick integration.
- **Improved behavior of single product widgets.** If you put a single product widget on your site using the [ecwid_product] shortcode, you might notice that it opens a popup with the customer cart when a customer purchases the product. Now single product widgets are smarter: when the customer decides to buy a product and opens a cart page, the main store page on your site will be opened providing the customer with the built-in cart&checkout functionality. The checkout layout will fit better your site design and provide better buying experience when it's embedded into a page rather than in a popup-like window.
- **Fix for the Envision theme.** The Envision theme didn't display Ecwid widgets properly because of a custom page content generation it uses. We issued a workaround from our side to let all Envision users install and use Ecwid plugin on their sites. If you use Envision theme and want to set up an online store on your site, go ahead and install Ecwid ecommerce plugin, it will work OK for you.
- **Fixes of PHP notices.** Some of Ecwid users discovered a few PHP notices (warnings) on their site referring to the Ecwid plugin. Although those didn't break anything, they could be quite annoying. We cleaned up the plugin code to get rid of those warning messages, now the plugin should work without any odd message. 

= 2.6 =
- **Ecwid's new SEO URLs compatibility.** The new Ecwid clean URLs have been released a few days ago for all Ecwid users. Our WordPress plugin is already fully compatible with the new URLs. Your online store pages will be better indexed by search engines and the search results will look more attractive as the links themselves will mention the product/category they lead to. Of course, Ecwid will handle all redirects, backward compatibility with the old URL scheme and avoid any duplicate issues. Enjoy the new SE-friendly URLs with no trouble.
- **Improved formatting of product snippets markup.** In this update we tidied up in the product HTML representations generated for search engines and fixes a few issues in the products data markup. In particular, the price and availability tags have been re-formatted according to the Google recommendations to ensure better search engine results.
- **A few improvements and fixes for Twenty Fourteen and Responsive themes layout.** Ecwid looks nice on the vast majority of WordPress themes. Additionally, we strive to make it look even better on the most popular themes. This update brings a few more minor layout fixes for the sites with "Responsive" and "Twenty Fourteen" themes installed. 

= 2.5 =
- **Extended compatibility with the "Responsive" WordPress theme.** Ecwid ecommerce plugin is by design compatible with any theme and automatically adapts itself to any layout and screen size. This makes your store looks good on any device your customers use. One of the most popular free themes for Wordpress -- Responsive -- is also famous for its  responsive design. In this update, we adjusted our plugin to better integrate with Responsive theme and Ecwid stores now look a way better on WordPress sites with Responsive themes to provide better user experience on any device and to generate more sales. If you're thinking which WP theme to choose for your site, you should definitely try the "Responsive" theme with Ecwid. 
- **Added compatibility with WordPress 4.0.** WordPress 4.0 is just around the corner and we already prepared our plugin for it. We enhanced the plugin installation process to be compatible with the new plugins management coming with WordPress 4.0 and tested every plugin's function to make sure your stores are ready for the upcoming WordPress update. 
- **Automatic store page recovery functionality.** Some Ecwid users previously faced issues when they deleted or replaced the plugin's generated store page on their Wordpress sites. We added a smart mechanism to Ecwid plugin to automatically detect such situations and prevent any possible troubles connected with them. Now, it you decide to move your store from one page to another within your Wordpress site or temporary hide your store page, the plugin will detect that, find an alternative store page on your site (if any) and keep the links and all the store functionality working OK regardless of whether you currently have a new store page or not. So, whatever update you're making on your site pages, you can rest assured your Ecwid store works fine, be it the product browser, single product snippet or a sidebar widget. 
- **Fixed broken link in single product widgets.** We fixed a minor issue with broken links in single product ecommerce widgets, that was reported to us recently. You can add a single product to any page of your site as usually by means of  [ecwid_product] shortcode -- everything will work fine. All existing single product widget will continue working as well -- no actions is required from your side.
- **Fixed a few layout issues on the plugin's setting pages.** During the recent updates, we were improving the plugin setting pages interfaces. This update brought a few more fixes to the plugin settings pages to make them more user-friendly.
- **Several fixes for old WordPress versions.** WordPress is often updated with new features and bug fixes. Still, there are some merchants who use the old versions. While encouraging everyone to update their sites regularly, we want our plugin work great for all users. So, in this update, we added a few fixes addressing issues in the old Wordpress versions (2.8 - 3.1)

= 2.4.3.2 =
- **Onboarding for the new plugin users.** Ecwid ecommerce plugin now displays new helpful messages when you set up your store and configure the setting. The messages guide the new users through the setup process and provide helpful tips and recommendations.

= 2.4.2 =

- Added compatibility with the new versions of "Google XML Sitemaps" plugin (v4.0 and higher)

= 2.4 =

To embed a product on a page or post, add [ecwid\_product id="12345"] shortcode to the page/post in your Wordpress backend. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID.

- **Better SEO for store pages.** Ecwid plug-in now automatically adds product attributes to SEO-optimized versions of product pages on your site to let the search engines index attributes like UPC, brand and others along with the other product properties. Also, some improvements were applied to the format of product HTML snippets to meet the Google recommendations on how to better organize ecommerce information (title, descriptions, price etc) on the product details pages. These improvements will help search engines to better index your products and optimize their appearance in search results. 

- **Slight improvements of store layout for mobile devices.** All Ecwid stores are mobile-friendly by design, i.e. they adapt themselves to the given layout and look good on mobile devices, so if your ecommerce site is mobile-optimized, your Ecwid store will be as well. Earlier, if you use horizontal categories widget on your Wordpress site, you might notice that it didn't fit the given width on narrow screens, e.g. when opened on a mobile device. Now, the plugin automatically hides horizontal categories widget on narrow screens to ensure better look on mobile-optimized sites.

- **Several improvements and bug fixes for plugin settings pages, store appearance and SEO.**

= 2.3.2 =
- **Fixed an issue in sitemap functionality**. Ecwid uses third party plugin to generate an XML sitemap (Google XML Sitemaps) for store products and categories. The current integration had a bug which caused an error message in Wordpress admin backend for users on Free Ecwid plan. Now it's fixed and everything should work OK.

= 2.3.1 =
- Automatic generation of the rel="canonical" links for SEO. Canonical links are aimed to specify the preferred (canonical) URL of the web page for search engines to prevent possible duplicate content issues. Ecwid plugin now generates such links automatically for product and categories pages in your store to provide search crawlers with well-structured content and help them better index your store.
- Improved compatibility with CloudFlare Rocket Loader. The merchants who use CloudFlare Rocket Loader extensions on their sites might previously experience issues with loading of their Ecwid stores. We've further improved the plugin code to prevent such issues in the future. Now Ecwid plugin should perfectly work with CloudFlare extensions.
- Several minor fixes and enhancements

= 2.3 =
- Added compatibility with Google XML Sitemaps plugin. Now you can submit your store items links along with the other site ecommerce pages to search engines.  To use this feature, please install the "Google XML Sitemaps" plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/), generate a sitemap (it will include your products and categories links) and submit it to the search engines to help them better crawl and categorize your site.

- Improved compatibility with SEO Ultimate plugin. Ecwid ecommerce plugin always displays your store pages in a proper SEO-friendly format to make the store indexable by search engines.

- Minor design improvements of the plugin settings pages to make them mobile-friendly for better compatibility with the backend layout of new Wordpress versions. Now you can manage Ecwid plugin settings in your Wordpress administrator panel using your mobile device.

  - <title> tags for categories. The SEO category pages in your online store now include both title and description tags so they will appear in Google search results properly.

- **Smooth HTTP/HTTPS switch**: Ecwid always transfers all sensitive ecommerce data using secure HTTPS connection and a special 'HTTPS' option in the Ecwid plugin settings is not necessary anymore. Now, the plugin detects connection type and adjust Ecwid integration codes automatically. No manual adjustments are needed regardless of whether you run your site under HTTP or HTTPS.

- [+] Ability to display separate categories on separate pages with custom shortcodes. Now, the plugin allows setting different default categories for different store pages. So if you have multiple store pages and want to display specific categories on them, you can set up a default category for each of them in the [ecwid\_productbrowser] shortcode like this: [ecwid\_productbrowser default\_category\_id="12345"] . On the other hand, if you have one store page, you can set the default category on the plugin settings page as usual.
- [+] A few more SEO improvements:
   - Product browser's default category ID setting is now taken into consideration by SEO part of the plugin. If you have multiple store pages displaying specific categories of your ecommerce store, search engines will index those pages starting from the proper category (not from the store's root)
   - <meta fragment="!"> tag is now displayed on every page where [ecwid\_productbrowser] tag is added so search engines will better index each store page
