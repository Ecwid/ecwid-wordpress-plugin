== Changelog ==
= 3.4.4 =
- **Added compatibility with the "Add Meta Tags" plugin.** The "Add Meta Tags" plugin is a popular tool to set SEO meta tags on site pages.

It's now fixed so if you use the plugin, everything should work fine and Google will index your products pages properly.
- **Fixed a problem in the recently viewed products widget caused by Autoptimize plugin.** Previously, if Autoptimize plugin is used on the site, the recently viewed products widget reset the displayed products when page reloads. We fixed that.

- **New look for the categories menu widget.** The old Ecwid categories menu widget (horizontal categories) was created long time ago and has been working in thousands of Ecwid stores. However, it doesn't adapt itself for the customer screen size as well as the other Ecwid widgets do. This has been always be a problem for responsive sites which look good on mobile devices. The new widget is fully responsive and looks great on mobile devices. To enable the new look of the categories widget on your site, navigate to Ecwid plugin settings -> "Advanced" tab and tick the "Enable the new category menu" checkbox. Once enabled, it will your store menu widget to the new look. If you don't have this option on the Advanced page, that means you installed the plugin after this change and the new categories are already enabled in your store. Enjoy! 
- **Bigger product images for search engines.** The plugin used to generate small product thumbnails on special store pages for search engines.

- **Fixed SEO issues on the sites with Genesis theme.** The Genesis theme places a special 'canonical' tag on each site page to improve the SEO of the pages. This in some cases conflicted with Ecwid plugin. We overcame this from our side and now the plugin is compatible with SEO features of Genesis theme – your store should be better indexed by search engines with this improvement. 
- **Fixed a bug with duplicate store pages that appeared if the user re-installed the plugin.** If you for some reason need to remove the plugin and install it again, everything will work smoothly now with no extra store pages drafts. 
- **Improve the search widget layout.** On a lot of Wordpress themes, the product search widget was displayed with 100% width, which makes the search input all-page-width. We fixed that and now it looks better.

- **Improved Single Sign On functionality.** Single Sign On module has been available in Ecwid Wordpress plugin for a while – it makes it possible for your customers to sign into your Wordpress site and fully use the Ecwid store installed on the site without having to sign in to Ecwid. Now we added a few improvements that should make the feature more useful. In particular, the Ecwid's "Sign in" link was usually hidden when Single Sign On is used, supposing a customer should use the Wordpress login functionality. Now, we made the link visible and redirecting to the Wordpress login form to avoid confusing the user who otherwise has to look for the area to login.
- **Storefront layout improvements for the "Evolve" WordPress theme.** We adjusted Ecwid plugin to better integrate with a popular and beautiful free Wordpress theme – Evolve. In particular, we fixed the borders appearing around every storefront element in this theme. Ecwid stores now look a way better on WordPress sites with Evolve theme to provide better customer experience on any device and to generate more sales in your store. 
- **Compatibility with Autoptimize plugin.** One of Ecwid users recently reported an issue – the plugin doesn't work well on the sites with Autoptimize plugin installed. We fixed this in our plugin – it is now working well with Autoptimize. Feel free to use it on your site. 
- **Improvements for Recently Viewed Products.** We included a few improvements and bug fixes for the recently viewed products widget in this release. 
- **Fixed a bug in the "Add store" button in Wordpress editor.** The authors of Easy Image Collage plugin recently discovered a problem in the way Ecwid "Add store" button interacts with the other custom button in the Wordpress WYSIWYG editor. It's fixed now. Thanks to Easy Image Collage team.

Whatever Wordpress theme you use, Ecwid will detect predominant colors and font and use them in your product catalog. The feature is by default disabled on the existing accounts to make sure the update will not affect your storefront. To enable it on your site, open the "Advanced" page in the Ecwid plugin settings and tick the "Chameleon skin" checkbox. The feature is in beta so if you find any troubles with it, please let us know. 
- **Pre-populate Ecwid registration form fields with user Wordpress profile data.** When a new user installs the plugin and registers an account at Ecwid, the registration form will contain the name and email prefilled to make it easy for the merchant to create a new store and install it on their site.

= 3.1 =
- **New recommendations block in Wordpress Dashboard.** Every Ecwid user has access to a lot of built-in features and third party applications that can be used to extend the store functionality and attract more sales. To make those features more visible and inform you of the new and existing tools you can use in your store, we added a new "Recommendations for your store" widget to the dashboard page in your Wordpress backend. We will update the content of this widget from time to time to provide more actual advice and inform of the new applications and features, so stay tuned.
- **Storefront layout improvements for the "Customizr" WordPress theme.** Ecwid plugin is by design compatible with any theme and looks good on any device and screen size your customers use.

Ecwid stores now look a way better on WordPress sites with Customizr themes to provide better customer experience on any device and to generate more sales in your store. 
- **Added German translations to the plugin settings pages in Wordpress admin backend.** Thanks to Stefan Wagner for the great job on the plugin translation.
- **Improved Italian translations for the plugin settings pages.** Big thanks to Luciano Delfico who has contributed a lot of Italian translations to Ecwid.

It now displays a link to the store page when there are no products in the list; the thumbnails pictures shown in the sidebar are now of the better quality; the currently opened product is now not displayed in the list if there are other recently viewed products.
- **Slight improvements in Single Sign On functionality.** If you use Single Sign On, the plugin will now send user first name and last name along with user email to your Ecwid store when a new user is registered on your site. This allows you to make tighter integration of your site and your Ecwid store – your customer name will appear at checkout automatically if they enter their name on your site.
- **Fixed an invalid meta description bug**, which appeared in some rare cases when product description contained special characters.
- **Fixed a bug in XML sitemap generation.** Some users faced a problem with XML sitemaps generated by Ecwid for Yoast SEO plugin (malformed product pages URLs). It's fixed. You can use Yoast SEO plugin to make your products listed in your XML site map.
- A few improvements in the plugin settings pages layout.

= 3.0 =
- **New sidebar widget: Recently Viewed Products.** A new Ecwid's sidebar widget is now available – your site can now show the products that the customer has recently visited. The links and images in the sidebar are updated automatically, so the customer can return to the product they previously opened and probably decide to buy it. This will increase visibility of your products for the customers and generate more sales. Enable the new widget under Appearance->Widgets menu in your admin backend.
- **New design of the plugin Dashboard.** The dashboard ("Ecwid") page in the plugin backend is now nicer and more useful. 
- **Completely redesigned Registration page.** This is for the new users of the plugin. When installing the plugin, a user will now see a beautiful welcome page that will introduce them to Ecwid and guide through the setup process. 
- **New easier store connection.** Previously, to connect an Ecwid store with a Wordpress site and display store products, a new user had to copy and paste their store ID from Ecwid Control Panel. Now, even this easy step became easier – the user only needs to click a few buttons to authorize themselves and the plugin will automatically detect and connect their store. For those with technical background: we use oAuth2 for this, which is now a part of the newest Ecwid API.


= 2.8 =
- **Integration with the XML sitemap functionality of Yoast and All in One SEO Pack plugins.** Ecwid has been integrated with Google XML Sitemaps plugin allowing you to generate a sitemap containing the links to your products and categories. Now, the sitemaps generated by Yoast SEO and All in One SEO plugins will also include store pages, if you're on a paid Ecwid plan.
- **Improved design of Ecwid sidebar controls in the Appearance/Widgets page in Wordpress backend.** Store sidebar widgets controls are now more noticeable and responsive.
- **Improved compatibility with the Cloudflare's Rocketloader.** Rocket loader tool sometimes blocked Ecwid scripts from loading. We added another improvements to prevent such issues.
- **Fixes and improvements of the meta title tag generation on product and categories pages.** 
- **A few minor fixes and adjustments.**

= 2.7.4.1 =
- Additional fixes for the "title" tags on product pages following the 2.7.4 version's updates.

= 2.7.4 =
- Improvements of 'title' and 'canonical' meta tags generation. The update prevents incorrect meta tags appearing in some WordPress themes in WordPress 4.1

= 2.7.3 =
- Several bug fixes and minor improvements for the new "Add Store" button in WordPress Editor

= 2.7.2 =
- **A new sidebar widget: Ecwid Store Page Link.** The widget adds your store page link to the site's sidebar. You may want to use it with blog-focused WordPress themes that don't have a navigation menu, e.g. the upcoming "Twenty Fifteen" theme. Also, you can consider adding the widget to your sidebar to make your store page more visible to your visitors. 
- **Wordpress 4.1 and Twenty Fifteen theme compatibility.** The new WordPress version is coming soon and bringing a brand new 'Twenty Fifteen' theme. Ecwid plugin is now totally ready for the upcoming changes and will work OK in the new environment. Feel free to upgrade your site to Wordpress 4.1 as soon as it's released.
- A few minor improvements and bugfixes for the new "Add Store" button released in the version 2.7

= 2.7.1 =
- Fixed a few issues with the store appearance settings that were discovered in the recently released update (v2.7)

= 2.7 =
- **A brand new 'Add store' tool in WordPress editor toolbar.** Ecwid is now integrated with WordPress WYSIWYG editor: click the 'Add Store' button in the page editor toolbar, chose widgets to show, adjust the appearance and place your store on any page of your site. Now you can decide what store widgets to show and configure store appearance right in the page editor.
- **New "[ecwid]" shortcode.** The new shortcode allows you to control every aspect of your store appearance by means of tweaking the shortcode parameters right in the store page code. Display/hide the search widget, choose the minicart layout you like, display different store categories on different site pages and so on. This shortcode serves the "Add Store" button mentioned above and almost every tweak is available in the new "Add Store" window so you don't have to edit any code in most cases. Still, an advanced Wordpress user may consider using shortcodes for more flexible and quick integration.
- **Improved behavior of single product widgets.** If you put a single product widget on your site using the [ecwid_product] shortcode, you might notice that it opens a popup with the customer cart when a customer purchases the product. Now single product widgets are smarter: when the customer decides to buy a product and opens a cart page, the main store page on your site will be opened providing the customer with the built-in cart&checkout functionality. The checkout layout will fit better your site design and provide better buying experience when it's embedded into a page rather than in a popup-like window.
- **Fix for the Envision theme.** The Envision theme didn't display Ecwid widgets properly because of a custom page content generation it uses. We issued a workaround from our side to let all Envision users install and use Ecwid plugin on their sites. If you use Envision theme and want to set up an online store on your site, go ahead and install Ecwid plugin, it will work OK for you.
- **Fixes of PHP notices.** Some of Ecwid users discovered a few PHP notices (warnings) on their site referring to the Ecwid plugin. Although those didn't break anything, they could be quite annoying. We cleaned up the plugin code to get rid of those warning messages, now the plugin should work without any odd message. 

= 2.6 =
- **Ecwid's new SEO URLs compatibility.** The new Ecwid clean URLs have been released a few days ago for all Ecwid users. Our WordPress plugin is already fully compatible with the new URLs. Your store pages will be better indexed by search engines and the search results will look more attractive as the links themselves will mention the product/category they lead to. Of course, Ecwid will handle all redirects, backward compatibility with the old URL scheme and avoid any duplicate issues. Enjoy the new SE-friendly URLs with no trouble.
- **Improved formatting of product snippets markup.** In this update we tidied up in the product HTML representations generated for search engines and fixes a few issues in the products data markup. In particular, the price and availability tags have been re-formatted according to the Google recommendations to ensure better search engine results.
- **A few improvements and fixes for Twenty Fourteen and Responsive themes layout.** Ecwid looks nice on the vast majority of WordPress themes. Additionally, we strive to make it look even better on the most popular themes. This update brings a few more minor layout fixes for the sites with "Responsive" and "Twenty Fourteen" themes installed. 

= 2.5 =
- **Extended compatibility with the "Responsive" WordPress theme.** Ecwid plugin is by design compatible with any theme and automatically adapts itself to any layout and screen size. This makes your store looks good on any device your customers use. One of the most popular free themes for Wordpress -- Responsive -- is also famous for its  responsive design. In this update, we adjusted our plugin to better integrate with Responsive theme and Ecwid stores now look a way better on WordPress sites with Responsive themes to provide better user experience on any device and to generate more sales. If you're thinking which WP theme to choose for your site, you should definitely try the "Responsive" theme with Ecwid. 
- **Added compatibility with WordPress 4.0.** WordPress 4.0 is just around the corner and we already prepared our plugin for it. We enhanced the plugin installation process to be compatible with the new plugins management coming with WordPress 4.0 and tested every plugin's function to make sure your stores are ready for the upcoming WordPress update. 
- **Automatic store page recovery functionality.** Some Ecwid users previously faced issues when they deleted or replaced the plugin's generated store page on their Wordpress sites. We added a smart mechanism to Ecwid plugin to automatically detect such situations and prevent any possible troubles connected with them. Now, it you decide to move your store from one page to another within your Wordpress site or temporary hide your store page, the plugin will detect that, find an alternative store page on your site (if any) and keep the links and all the store functionality working OK regardless of whether you currently have a new store page or not. So, whatever update you're making on your site pages, you can rest assured your Ecwid store works fine, be it the product browser, single product snippet or a sidebar widget. 
- **Fixed broken link in single product widgets.** We fixed a minor issue with broken links in single product widgets, that was reported to us recently. You can add a single product to any page of your site as usually by means of  [ecwid_product] shortcode -- everything will work fine. All existing single product widget will continue working as well -- no actions is required from your side.
- **Fixed a few layout issues on the plugin's setting pages.** During the recent updates, we were improving the plugin setting pages interfaces. This update brought a few more fixes to the plugin settings pages to make them more user-friendly.
- **Several fixes for old WordPress versions.** WordPress is often updated with new features and bug fixes. Still, there are some merchants who use the old versions. While encouraging everyone to update their sites regularly, we want our plugin work great for all users. So, in this update, we added a few fixes addressing issues in the old Wordpress versions (2.8 - 3.1)

= 2.4.3.2 =
- **Onboarding for the new plugin users.** Ecwid plugin now displays new helpful messages when you set up your store and configure the setting. The messages guide the new users through the setup process and provide helpful tips and recommendations.
- **Improvements in the plugin settings pages and messages.** We updated the texts and styles of the messages displayed on the settings pages. They became clearer and more user-friendly.
- **Minor optimizations for search engines** including tidying up of the product pages 'meta' descriptions tags and fixing potential issues in compatibility with Yoast SEO plugin. This is to ensure better indexation and appearing of your products in the search results.
- **Several minor fixes and enhancements**
- **Added in 2.4.3.1:** fixed incompatibility of the plugin v2.4.3 with the servers running PHP 5.2.x
- **Added in 2.4.3.2:** additional fix for the outdated PHP versions (5.2.x)

= 2.4.2 =
- Minor issue is fixed on the plugin's "General settings" page

= 2.4.1 =
- Added compatibility with the new versions of "Google XML Sitemaps" plugin (v4.0 and higher)

= 2.4 =
- **Ability to add a single product to a page or post on your site using new [ecwid\_product] shortcode.** In addition to embedding a whole product catalog on your Wordpress site, you can also feature a single product on a separate page or blog post of your site and allow your customers to purchase the product right from that page. To embed a product on a page or post, add [ecwid\_product id="12345"] shortcode to the page/post in your Wordpress backend. Do not forget to replace 12345 in this example with the actual product ID.

- **Better SEO for store pages.** Ecwid plug-in now automatically adds product attributes to SEO-optimized versions of product pages on your site to let the search engines index attributes like UPC, brand and others along with the other product properties. Also, some improvements were applied to the format of product HTML snippets to meet the Google recommendations on how to better organize product information (title, descriptions, price etc) on the product details pages. These improvements will help search engines to better index your products and optimize their appearance in search results. 

- **Slight improvements of store layout for mobile devices.** All Ecwid stores are mobile-friendly by design, i.e. they adapt themselves to the given layout and look good on mobile devices, so if your site is mobile-optimized, your Ecwid store will be as well. Earlier, if you use horizontal categories widget on your Wordpress site, you might notice that it didn't fit the given width on narrow screens, e.g. when opened on a mobile device. Now, the plugin automatically hides horizontal categories widget on narrow screens to ensure better look on mobile-optimized sites.

- **Several improvements and bug fixes for plugin settings pages, store appearance and SEO.**

= 2.3.2 =
- **Fixed an issue in sitemap functionality**. Ecwid uses third party plugin to generate an XML sitemap (Google XML Sitemaps) for store products and categories. The current integration had a bug which caused an error message in Wordpress admin backend for users on Free Ecwid plan. Now it's fixed and everything should work OK.

= 2.3.1 =
- Automatic generation of the rel="canonical" links for SEO. Canonical links are aimed to specify the preferred (canonical) URL of the web page for search engines to prevent possible duplicate content issues. Ecwid plugin now generates such links automatically for product and categories pages in your store to provide search crawlers with well-structured content and help them better index your store.
- Improved compatibility with CloudFlare Rocket Loader. The merchants who use CloudFlare Rocket Loader extensions on their sites might previously experience issues with loading of their Ecwid stores. We've further improved the plugin code to prevent such issues in the future. Now Ecwid plugin should perfectly work with CloudFlare extensions.
- Several minor fixes and enhancements

= 2.3 =
- Added compatibility with Google XML Sitemaps plugin. Now you can submit your store items links along with the other site pages to search engines.  To use this feature, please install the "Google XML Sitemaps" plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/), generate a sitemap (it will include your products and categories links) and submit it to the search engines to help them better crawl and categorize your site.

- Improved compatibility with SEO Ultimate plugin. Ecwid plugin always displays your store pages in a proper SEO-friendly format to make the store indexable by search engines. Moreover, we constantly adjust the plugin to make it work fine with popular third party SEO modules. So Ecwid is perfectly compatible with "Wordpress SEO by Yoast", "All in one SEO Pack", "Platinum SEO Pack" and now with "SEO Ultimate" plugin.

- Minor design improvements of the plugin settings pages to make them mobile-friendly for better compatibility with the backend layout of new Wordpress versions. Now you can manage Ecwid plugin settings in your Wordpress administrator panel using your mobile device.

- New "Ecwid badges" widget is available.

Now, the plugin detects connection type and adjust Ecwid integration codes automatically. No manual adjustments are needed regardless of whether you run your site under HTTP or HTTPS.

- [+] Improved compatibility with popular SEO plugins (Yoast WordPress SEO, All in one SEO Pack and Platinum SEO pack) : now Ecwid prevents them from generating wrong title and canonical tags on the product pages.
- [+] Ability to display separate categories on separate pages with custom shortcodes. Now, the plugin allows setting different default categories for different store pages. So if you have multiple store pages and want to display specific categories on them, you can set up a default category for each of them in the [ecwid\_productbrowser] shortcode like this: [ecwid\_productbrowser default\_category\_id="12345"] . On the other hand, if you have one store page, you can set the default category on the plugin settings page as usual.
- [+] A few more SEO improvements:
   - Product browser's default category ID setting is now taken into consideration by SEO part of the plugin. If you have multiple store pages displaying specific categories of your shop, search engines will index those pages starting from the proper category (not from the store's root)
   - <meta fragment="!"> tag is now displayed on every page where [ecwid\_productbrowser] tag is added so search engines will better index each store page
- [+] We also released a lot of new Ecwid features. You can read about them there: http://www.ecwid.com/blog/new-releases/
